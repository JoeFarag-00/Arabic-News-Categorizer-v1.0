[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open source platform
for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of
[tools](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/tools),
[libraries](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions), and
[community](https://www.tensorflow.org/community) resources that lets
researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and
deploy ML-powered applications.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the
Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to
conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is
general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

TensorFlow provides stable [Python](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python)
and [C++](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc) APIs, as well as
non-guaranteed backward compatible API for
[other languages](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs).

to
[announce@tensorflow.org](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/announce).
See all the [mailing lists](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/forums).

## Install

See the [TensorFlow install guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for the
[pip package](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip), to
[enable GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu), use a
[Docker container](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker), and
[build from source](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source).

To install the current release, which includes support for
[CUDA-enabled GPU cards](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) *(Ubuntu and
Windows)*:

```
$ pip install tensorflow
```

Other devices (DirectX and MacOS-metal) are supported using
[Device plugins](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu_plugins#available_devices).

A smaller CPU-only package is also available:

```
$ pip install tensorflow-cpu
```

To update TensorFlow to the latest version, add `--upgrade` flag to the above
commands.

*Nightly binaries are available for testing using the
[tf-nightly](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tf-nightly) and
[tf-nightly-cpu](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tf-nightly-cpu) packages on PyPi.*

#### *Try your first TensorFlow program*

```shell
$ python
```

```python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> tf.add(1, 2).numpy()
3
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> hello.numpy()
b'Hello, TensorFlow!'
```

For more examples, see the
[TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).

## Running the project...
The model has a 0.98 accuracy
Categories include:
1. Politics
2. Economy
3. Entertainment
4. Sports

1. First download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haithemhermessi/sanad-dataset).
2. Train the model using the "train.py file", make sure you hooked the correct path to your dataset and stopwords list.
3. After running the CNN model, run the "classify.py" file and input test articles.

*Make sure the generated cnn_model.h5 and word2vec.model path is hooked to the classify file.
